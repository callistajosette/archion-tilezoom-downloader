This is a helper extension designed for downloading full-size images from `archion.de`. `archion.de` currently uses the [Tilezoom plugin](https://github.com/ematsakov/tilezoom) to tile its high-resolution images; therefore, this extension is only scoped to this site and plugin. You can download any resolution provided by the site, if you have access as a paid member.
